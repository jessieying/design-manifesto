## Welcome to My Site

In D-Term of 2018, I took a course on Human-Computer Interaction at Worcester Polytechnic Institute with Professor Lane Harrison. Throughout the term, we learned a lot about design processes and solutions involved in building applications, and how those design choices impact a user’s overall experience. In groups of 3–4 students, we explored specific aspects of human-centered design by creating prototype applications and documenting the entire process. While doing so, I found that for each of these applications, I started following a general design pattern based off of strategies and principles we learned from class. Below, I explain my design processes, along with how they correspond to the projects I worked on throughout this term. Feel free to keep reading to learn more about my design manifesto, or check out my portfolio of projects at the bottom of this page!

# A Little About Me

Hi, my name is Jessie Ying and I am currently a junior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I’m studying computer science and I’ve always been interested in design, so Human-Computer Interaction was definitely an exciting topic for me to learn about. In the future, I hope to apply what I’ve learned from this course to applications I create or work on, in order to provide the best user experience I can. Outside of class, I like playing ultimate frisbee, going for runs, and spending time with my two dogs.

# My Design Manifesto and Projects

During my design process for building applications, I was able to apply a lot of what I learned from class and readings to my projects. In doing so, I was able to establish five key steps that are necessary in creating a successful application: brainstorming, establishing an objective, user testing, feedback gathering, and reflection and repeat.

### Brainstorming: Coming up with as many ideas as possible

The design processes for each of our projects always started with brainstorming. We wanted to come up with as many as ideas as possible during this phase; any and every idea was acceptable. An strong emphasis was placed on quantity over quality, because it was necessary to have as many ideas as we could (even the bad ones), so that we can figure out how to make those ideas better and combine the best parts of all of our ideas to create the best product we can. The reading [How to be Creative](http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/books/design-methods/how-to-be-creative.html) discusses this strategy and encourages externalizing bad ideas to figure out what’s wrong with those ideas and how to improve them.

In [Design for Wellbeing](https://medium.com/design-for-wellbeing/design-for-wellbeing-creating-an-emotion-detector-to-control-videos-41709636be07, we came up with a lot of ideas from our initial brainstorming session, which was very helpful later on when deciding what application to build. We were able to compare the all ideas we came up with and pick the one we thought would be best, while incorporating cool features from our other ideas into our final application as well. Below are the sheets from our brainstorming session:

Another reading, [Ideation Overview](https://kixlab.org/courses/cs374-spring-2017/classes/08-Ideation/), talked about how group brainstorming by itself is not the most effective for coming up with as many ideas as possible. Instead, each member should generate ideas individually and then come together to share and build on each other’s ideas. In [Designing for Another World](https://medium.com/@robertharrison43/design-for-another-world-603bed415e64), my group implemented this strategy and we were able to come up with an overwhelming amount of ideas, which was really great. The results from our group brainstorming session (after each of us shared our own ideas) are shown below:

### Establishing an objective: Making the purpose clear

I found that establishing a clear objective before diving in and building our application was super important and made the overall process a lot easier. It was crucial to set a goal and define the purpose of the application before starting. For example, if the application is trying to solve a problem, what is the scope of the problem and how does the appplication target this?

In the first few assignments, we were given the scope of project as well as our objective and target audience. In [Designing for Others](https://medium.com/@Avorent/an-alternate-design-for-worcester-public-library-21d8021b470c), our goal was to prototype a mobile version of the Worcester Public Library site and cater it towards parents of children ages 3–10. This made it easy for us to jump right in and start designing, so I didn’t really think too much of this step as a crucial one in the design process. However, by the end of the term, the projects were a lot more open-ended, so when we had to establish our own objectives and goals for the user, I found it much more difficult to define our application’s purpose. In [Designing for Tension](https://medium.com/@john3r8amaral/design-for-tension-8081059ed3e5), we had to decide on a topic and the specific use of our chatbot as well as our target audience. [Designing for Another World](https://medium.com/@robertharrison43/design-for-another-world-603bed415e64) was even more open-ended, and we could pick any scene or world to simulate in our virtual reality application.
