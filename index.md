## Welcome to My Site
    
    
    

In D-Term of 2018, I took a course on Human-Computer Interaction at Worcester Polytechnic Institute with Professor Lane Harrison. Throughout the term, we learned a lot about design processes and solutions involved in building applications, and how those design choices impact a user’s overall experience. In groups of 3–4 students, we explored specific aspects of human-centered design by creating prototype applications and documenting the entire process. While doing so, I found that for each of these applications, I started following a general design pattern based off of strategies and principles we learned from class. Below, I explain my design processes, along with how they correspond to the projects I worked on throughout this term. Feel free to keep reading to learn more about my design manifesto, or check out my portfolio of projects at the bottom of this page!

### A Little About Me

Hi, my name is Jessie Ying and I am currently a junior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I’m studying computer science and I’ve always been interested in design, so Human-Computer Interaction was definitely an exciting topic for me to learn about. In the future, I hope to apply what I’ve learned from this course to applications I create or work on, in order to provide the best user experience I can. Outside of class, I like playing ultimate frisbee, going for runs, and spending time with my two dogs.
