### Welcome to My Site

In D-Term of 2018, I took a course on Human-Computer Interaction at Worcester Polytechnic Institute with Professor Lane Harrison. Throughout the term, we learned a lot about design processes and solutions involved in building applications, and how those design choices impact a user’s overall experience. In groups of 3–4 students, we explored specific aspects of human-centered design by creating prototype applications and documenting the entire process. While doing so, I found that for each of these applications, I started following a general design pattern based off of strategies and principles we learned from class. Below, I explain my design processes, along with how they correspond to the projects I worked on throughout this term. Feel free to keep reading to learn more about my design manifesto, or check out my portfolio of projects at the bottom of this page!

## A Little About Me

Hi, my name is Jessie Ying and I am currently a junior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I’m studying computer science and I’ve always been interested in design, so Human-Computer Interaction was definitely an exciting topic for me to learn about. In the future, I hope to apply what I’ve learned from this course to applications I create or work on, in order to provide the best user experience I can. Outside of class, I like playing ultimate frisbee, going for runs, and spending time with my two dogs.

## My Design Manifesto and Projects

During my design process for building applications, I was able to apply a lot of what I learned from class and readings to my projects. In doing so, I was able to establish five key steps that are necessary in creating a successful application: brainstorming, establishing an objective, user testing, feedback gathering, and reflection and repeat.

**Brainstorming: Coming up with as many ideas as possible**
The design processes for each of our projects always started with brainstorming. We wanted to come up with as many as ideas as possible during this phase; any and every idea was acceptable. An strong emphasis was placed on quantity over quality, because it was neccessary to have as many ideas as we could, to have more options of what to create. Later on in the design process would be where the focus shifts to improving the quality of the application.
