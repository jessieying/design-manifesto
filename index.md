### Design Manifesto and Projects

In D-Term of 2018, I took a course on Human-Computer Interaction with Professor Lane Harrison. Throughout the course, we learned a lot about the design process of creating applications and how those design choices impact a user’s experience.

### A Little About Me

Hi, my name is Jessie Ying and I am currently a junior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I’m studying computer science and I’ve always been interested in design, so Human-Computer Interaction was definitely an exciting topic for me to learn about. In the future, I hope to apply what I've learned from this course to applications I create or work on, in order to provide the best user experience I can. Outside of classes, I like playing ultimate frisbee, going for runs, and spending time with my two dogs!
