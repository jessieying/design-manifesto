### A Little About Me

Hi, my name is Jessie Ying and I’m a junior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I’m studying computer science and I’ve always been interested in design, so Human-Computer Interaction was definitely an exciting topic for me to learn about. In the future, I hope to apply what I've learned from this course to applications I create or work on, in order to provide the best user experience I can. Outside of classes, I like playing ultimate frisbee, going for runs, and spending time with my two dogs!
